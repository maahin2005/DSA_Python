# Introduction to Two Pointer Technique (5 minutes)

1. What is the Two Pointer Technique?

   - A technique to solve problems efficiently by using two pointers (indices) to traverse data structures like arrays or linked lists.

   - Commonly used in problems involving sorted arrays, sliding windows, or searching pairs.

2. When to use it?

   - When you need to find a pair of elements, subarrays, or perform operations on sorted/unsorted arrays with optimal time complexity (often O(n)).
